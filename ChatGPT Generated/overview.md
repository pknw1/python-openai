Yes, your requirements are clear. Here's a high-level outline of the steps involved in creating an end-to-end application for scraping, processing, and querying data:

1. Web Scraping:
   - Identify the website(s) you want to scrape.
   - Use a web scraping library like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to retrieve the source file or page content from each defined web source.
   - Store the scraped data locally, preferably in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) for further processing.

2. File Processing:
   - Identify the local Unix folder containing the files you want to process.
   - Use standard file I/O operations to read the contents of each file.
   - Store the file contents locally, preferably in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) for further processing.

3. Data Cleansing:
   - Write a script to cleanse the data, removing unwanted characters, line breaks, or any other irrelevant information. You can use regular expressions or string manipulation techniques for this task.
   - Store the cleansed data separately.

4. Data Chunking:
   - Write a script to split the cleansed data into smaller chunks that can be efficiently tokenized by TikToken. The chunk size will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of TikToken.
   - Store the chunked data separately.

5. Tokenization:
   - Write a script to tokenize the chunks of data using TikToken or any other appropriate tokenizer. You may need to install TikToken and its dependencies.
   - Store the tokenized data separately.

6. Embedding Creation:
   - Write a script to create embeddings from the tokenized data using the OpenAI API or any other embedding model.
   - Store the embeddings locally, ensuring they are in a suitable format for querying.

7. Flask Web Interface:
   - Set up a Flask application to serve as the user interface.
   - Design the web interface to allow interactive chat.
   - Implement the logic to receive user queries, encode them appropriately, and retrieve the most relevant responses using the stored embeddings.

By separating the stages of data acquisition, cleansing, chunking, tokenization, and embedding creation, you can manually trigger each process as needed. Once the data is ready and the Flask web interface is implemented, you can use it to query the processed and encoded dataset.

Remember to handle any necessary error checking, logging, and potential scalability considerations as you build each component of your application.
