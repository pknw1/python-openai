Certainly! I can provide you with code snippets for each stage along with Dockerfiles and requirements.txt files. However, due to the character limitations, I'll provide you with the code for the first three stages in this response. I'll continue with the remaining stages in the next response. Please note that the code snippets provided are simplified examples, and you may need to adapt them to your specific use case.

1. Web Scraping:
Python code (`web_scraping.py`):
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Define the URL(s) to scrape
urls = ['https://example.com/page1', 'https://example.com/page2']

# Loop through each URL and scrape the content
for url in urls:
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    # Process and store the scraped data
    # ...

# Example: storing the scraped data as JSON
# import json
# with open('scraped_data.json', 'w') as f:
#     json.dump(scraped_data, f)
```

Dockerfile for web scraping (`Dockerfile_web_scraping`):
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.1-alpine

```

You can then run the web scraping stage as a Docker container using:
```
docker run --name web_scraping_container web_scraping_image
```

2. File Processing:
Python code (`file_processing.py`):
```python
import os

# Define the path to the local Unix folder containing the files

for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        # Process and store the file contents
        # ...

# Example: storing the processed file contents as JSON

```python
import re

# Read the data to be cleansed from a file or

 any other source
data = 'Sample data\nwith line breaks'

# Cleanse the data by removing line breaks
cleansed_data = re.sub(r'\n', '', data)

# Store the cleansed data
# ...

# Example: storing the cleansed data as a file
# with open('cleansed_data.txt', 'w') as f:
#     f.write(cleansed_data)
```

Dockerfile for data cleansing (`Dockerfile_data_cleansing`):
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.1-alpine

# Chunk the data
chunks = [cleansed_data[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(cleansed_data), chunk_size)]

# Store the chunked data
# ...

# Example: storing the chunked data as a file
# with open('chunked_data.txt', 'w') as f:
#     for chunk in chunks:
#         f.write(chunk + '\n')
```

# Store the tokenized data
# ...

# Example: storing the tokenized data as a file
# with open('tokenized_data.txt', 'w') as f:
#     for tokens in tokenized_data:
#         f.write(' '.join(tokens) + '\n')
```

Dockerfile for tokenization (`Dockerfile_tokenization`):
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.1-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Process each tokenized chunk and create embeddings
for tokens in tokenized_data:
    response = openai.Embed.create(model='text-davinci-003', tokens=tokens)
    embeddings.extend(response['embeddings'])

# Store the embeddings
# ...

# Example: storing the embeddings as a file
# import numpy as np
# np.save('embeddings.npy', embeddings)
```

Dockerfile for embedding creation (`Dockerfile_embedding_creation`):
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.1-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY embedding_creation.py .

CMD [ "python", "embedding_creation.py" ]
```

requirements.txt for embedding creation (`requirements_embedding_creation.txt`):
```
openai==0.31.0
```

```
docker build -t embedding_creation_image -f Dockerfile_embedding_creation .
```

You can then run the embedding creation stage as a Docker container using:
```
docker run --name embedding_creation_container --env OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY embedding_creation_image
```
Note: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

7. Flask Web Interface:
Python code (`app.py`):
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Assuming you have already loaded the embeddings into a variable called `embeddings`

@app.route('/query', methods=['POST'])
def query():
    query_text = request.json['query']

    # Process the query and find the most relevant response using the embeddings
    # ...

    # Example: returning a dummy response for demonstration
    response = {'response': 'This is a sample response.'}

    return jsonify(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

Dockerfile for Flask web interface (`Dockerfile_flask_web`):
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.1-alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY app.py .

CMD [ "python", "app.py" ]
```

requirements.txt for Flask web interface (`requirements_flask_web.txt`):
```
flask==2.1.0
```

You can build the Docker image for the Flask web interface using the following command:
```
docker build -t flask_web_image -f Dockerfile_flask_web .
```

You can then run the Flask web interface as a Docker container using:
```
docker run --name flask_web_container -p 5000:5000 flask_web_image
```

With this setup, the Flask web interface will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You can send POST requests to `http://localhost:5000/query` with a JSON payload containing the user query. The Flask app will process the query and return the most appropriate response based on the stored embeddings.
